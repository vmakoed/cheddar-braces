# cheddar-braces

A simple script checking whether a string is balanced.
A string is balanced if it has a closing bracket/brace for each opening bracket/brace.

Balanced strings:
* `'()'`
* `'[]'`
* `'[([(([()]))])]'`
* `''` (empty string)

Imbalanced strings:
* `'('`
* `']'`
* `'(()'`
* `']['`
* `'([)]'`
